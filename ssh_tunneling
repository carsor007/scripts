ssh -f -L 2222:remotehost:22 localhost -N

N dont execute command on local host
-f forward
-L local port

ssh-keygen
ssh-cpy-id localhost
ssh localhost
ssh -p 2222 user@localhost

what I've done is connected to port 2222 on localhost but its actually being forwarded to remote host

ssh -f -L 3000:remote:3128 localhost -N
