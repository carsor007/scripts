Networking in UNIX is fairly simple and straightforward. UNIX networking is based on the TCP/IP suite of protocols, which is also the main protocol of the internet, making it the logical choice for a system to connect to the internet.

Starting TCP/IP is fairly simple on most systems, by using the "ifconfig" (interace configuration) command. The format for the ifconfig is usually

config <device> <address>

Example from a solaris machine displaying it's configuration:
: ifconfig -a
lo0: flags=1000849<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 8232 index 1
inet 127.0.0.1 netmask ff000000 
hme0: flags=1000843<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST,IPv4> mtu 1500 index 2
inet 192.168.28.76 netmask ffffff00 broadcast 192.168.28.255
ether 8:0:20:f8:e7:86 

Look at the second line:

The interface name is hme0
it has an ip address of 192.168.28.76
it is on network 192.168.28.0/24
the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0
This machine will listen on the interface hme0 and will only process requests for network 192.168.28.0/24.

We can tell that this is a class C address, by the network number.

For this network ip address and subnetmaks the network is: 192.168.28.0 and the broadcast address for the network is 192.168.28.255

Reminder on a network, you loose the first address as the network name and the last address as the broadcase address.

Running the command,

netstat -rn

# -r show routes
# -n don't resolve the network addresses to names

Routing Table: IPv4
Destination Gateway Flags Ref Use Interface
-------------------- -------------------- ----- ----- ------ ---------
192.168.28.0 192.168.28.76 U 1 25557 hme0
224.0.0.0 192.168.28.76 U 1 0 hme0
default 192.168.28.1 UG 1 1396 
127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1 UH 3 118 lo0

You can see from this the network name and the default network.
